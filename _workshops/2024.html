<p> 
It is our pleasure to announce the in-person NYRIA Workshop 2024! 
Our 9th annual workshop will be co-organized and hosted by the University 
of California San Diego from October 21st to 25th, 2024, in San Diego, 
California, United States.
</p>

<p> 
The workshop is designed to encourage early career researchers, 
(i.e. masters students to senior postdocs) working in <b>ground-based, visible 
and infrared instrumentation</b> for astronomy to engage with each other in a 
friendly environment. Attendees will have the opportunity to present their 
work, network with peers, and develop collaborations with other participants 
from institutes around the world. The workshop will include a series of talks 
from each participant in addition to a few talks from invited speakers, a tour 
of local astronomical facilities, and a hackathon in which participants will work 
together to solve an instrumentation-themed problem.
</p>

<p>
During the workshop, lunches, and coffee breaks will be provided for all participants. 
We will also provide shared accommodation for all accepted participants. In addition,
for the first time, we have limited funding to help finance travel to the workshop thanks 
to the generous support from the Heising-Simons Foundation.
